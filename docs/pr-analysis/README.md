## How to run the code:

### Install Necessary Modules
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Note:** you may need to install the python3-tkinter package for graphs to display.

### Add a Token
Before you run the code, you must add a personal github token. The token can be generated by following this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

You can add the token in the command line by running `export GH_TOKEN=<yourtoken>`

To run the code, you can use this command: `python PR_analysis.py`

### Results
Once the code is finished running, you will have two png files and one csv file saved in this folder. 

These are the graphs from the analysis of the queried data and the information about which PRs that have been merged in each month.

In PR_Info_Monthly.csv you can search all the Pull Requests based on Year-Month.
